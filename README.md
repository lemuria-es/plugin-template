# plugin-template
This repository serves as a basic template to be used when creating a plugin for the game Endless Sky. There is a big `Use this template` button. Click it, and GitHub will make a repository for you. Then, if you have git installed, just clone it in your Endless Sky plugin directory, open up a text editor, and start modding!

[Creating a repository from a template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template#creating-a-repository-from-a-template)


## Things to do after forking:
1. Clone your repo locally. You'll want to clone / symlink your repo within the `"plugins"` directory in your "user" directory (which is where Endless Sky writes your pilot savegames). This ensures you can update your local version of Endless Sky without worrying about losing any uncommitted & unpushed data.
2. Flesh out your content! You can learn about all the different bits of game data in the [Endless Sky wiki](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/wiki/CreatingPlugins)
3. [Submit your plugin for distribution](https://github.com/EndlessSkyCommunity/endless-sky-plugins) (to be updated)
